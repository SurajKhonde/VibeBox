# 🛣️ Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the current status, upcoming features, and long-term goals of **Music Backend**.  
We aim to build a **scalable, cost-effective, and production-ready music streaming backend** that showcases real-world engineering practices.

---

## ✅ Completed
- [x] Upload songs to AWS S3  
- [x] Store song metadata in MongoDB  
- [x] Generate signed streaming URLs (expire after 15 min)  

---

## 🔄 In Progress
- [ ] Aggregation pipelines for insights:  
  - Trending songs  
  - Most played  
  - Favorite singers  
- [ ] User authentication with JWT + Cookies  

---

## 🚀 Coming Soon
- [ ] Playlists (create, update, delete, fetch)  
- [ ] Favorites / Likes system  
- [ ] Role-based access (Admin / User)  
- [ ] Advanced search and filters  
- [ ] Swagger / OpenAPI documentation  

---

## 🎯 Long-Term Vision
- [ ] **Analytics Dashboard**: Admin insights into users, plays, and trends.  
- [ ] **Serverless Scaling**: Explore AWS Lambda & MongoDB Atlas for cost-effective scaling.  
- [ ] **Global CDN Support**: Faster delivery for songs worldwide.  
- [ ] **Caching Layer**: Redis or in-memory cache for high-traffic APIs.  
- [ ] **Microservices Migration**: Modular architecture as project grows.  
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated tests, builds, and deployments.  

---

## 📌 Notes
- We follow the principle of **clean, maintainable, production-ready code**.  
- We avoid over-engineering (e.g., no Redis or EC2 yet, as we don’t need them).  
- Every feature is built to be **educational** and demonstrate **real-world tradeoffs**.
