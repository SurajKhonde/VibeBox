# 🎶 Music Backend (Open Source)

We are building a **music streaming backend** powered by **MongoDB aggregations**, **Node.js**, and **AWS S3**.  
This project is designed to simulate real-world production challenges while keeping the system **cost-effective, maintainable, and scalable**.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision
The goal is to create a **production-ready backend** that:
- Tracks **most famous singers, songs, and user activity** using MongoDB aggregation pipelines.
- Provides **fast and secure streaming** with AWS S3 + signed URLs.
- Maintains **clean and effective code** without unnecessary over-engineering.
- Balances **scalability vs cost** (e.g., why not use Redis or EC2 yet).
- Demonstrates **real-world trade-offs** (serverless cold starts, DB connection pooling, etc.).

This project is a playground for developers who want to **learn, contribute, and showcase** how real-world backend systems are designed and maintained.

## 🧑‍💻 Engineering Principles
1. **Write and maintain clean code** — keep it readable and consistent.  
2. **Cost-effective solutions first** — optimize only when scale demands it.  
3. **Scalable, production-ready patterns** — no hacks, no shortcuts.  
4. **Avoid over-engineering** — add Redis, caching, or microservices only when required.  
5. **Address real-world issues**:
   - AWS Lambda cold start → connection pooling for MongoDB.  
   - DB efficiency → aggregation pipelines instead of N queries.  
   - Server costs → leverage serverless & S3 instead of heavy infra.
